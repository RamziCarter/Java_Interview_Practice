```java

String color = "blue";

switch(color) {
                case "red": System.out.println("The color is red!");
                break;
                case "green: System.out.println("The color is green!");
                break;
                case "yellow": System.out.println("The color is yellow!");
                break;
                case "blue": System.out.println("The color is blue!");
                break;
                case "white": System.out.println("The color is white!");
                break;
                default: System.out.println("The color is not here!");
              }
