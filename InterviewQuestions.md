### Cover Letter Information

My computer science journey began in 2017, when I attended a Hackathon. This was my first ever exposure to programming and technical collaboration. The team and I created an application called "KidFit." The goal of the application was to promote a healthy lifestyle for youth by monitoring body mass index, tracking calories and logging physical activity/workouts; there was even a section to recommend healthy meal options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This experience sparked a new interest for logical thinking, programming, collaboration, problem solving, debugging and more. 

My freshman year in college is where the foundation for my computer science journey began. We were taught the basics in python during the first semester. I found great joy learning how to run loops, create functions, use data structures and solve complex problems. The satisfaction I received after working through various algorithms was outstanding. As my journey continued, I began to learn different languages such as java, C, C#, html and CSS and more. Through college, I was tasked with class projects, some needed to be completed by myself and others with team members. This taught me to meet deliverables, utilize resources and work efficiently. 

Today, I am eagerly searching for a position that will allow me to grow and develop within the software field as a well rounded developer!
